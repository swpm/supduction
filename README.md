# supduction
Strategic Wargame Production Model - Supply Production Distribution

Supduction is a Supply Production and Distribution framework to support strategic games that need such simulation. It is written in python. It is covered by the BSD License (3-clause variant).

Supduction models the gathering of supply generation inputs (i.e. raw materials), the production method (i.e. what is needed and how long does it take), and the distribution of the finished resources. The target application is wargames, but it could be applied in other areas. In such games, supduction isn't the main simulator and doesn't currently (Dec 2015) support modeling of research.

Features:
1. Autonomous Agent Model Backbone

2. Routed Movement and Graph Path Finding

3. Models for Generation and Gathering of Raw Resources

4. Models for Production Facilies

5. Models for Production Processes

6. Damage Model

7. Supply Transport Modeling

8. Queues, Orders, and Messaging
