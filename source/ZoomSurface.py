		the optional addition of a specified source surface.

		The source surface defaults to None, which is really useless unless you
		set_source() soon after...

		This was written mainly with the intent of making small-scale graphics
		work visible while debugging, although I think it could also be used
		to show a miniature of a large surface, instead.  (eg: an inset map of
		the whole world while one sector of it is on screen)

		Possibly useless technical note:  if given a tuple, this function will
		use the transform.scale() function, or if given a scaling factor, will
		use tranform.rotozoom() (with rotation==0)
